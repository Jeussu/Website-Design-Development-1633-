I.  	Principle of Design Website:    
 When designing a professional website, you must harmonize elements to create a complete website. Website interface must be linked together and each person has a different design style but always ensure the necessary elements to create a professional website. Here are the web design principles Standards  1. Purpose  
Good web design must always match the needs of users, capture customer psychology. Each page in your site needs a clear purpose and to meet the specific needs of website users in the most effective way possible.  
2. Website layout must be clear and coherent  
Placing random content on your site can cause a messy image. Grid-based layouts will divide content into sections, columns and boxes by lines and create a sense of balance, harmony, leading to a more beautiful website design.  3. Easy to navigate:  
Navigation is easy for people to make and move around your site. Some effective navigation strategies include a logical page hierarchy, using link patterns of information patterns, designing clickable buttons and following 'three-click rules' (three clicks rule), this means that users will be able to find the information they are looking for within three mouse clicks.  
4. Use limited, easy-to-understand words using multiple words 5. Quick page loading speed:  
People are annoyed with a site that takes a long time to load. Tips to make page load times more efficient include: Optimizing image size (size and size), combining code into a central CSS or JavaScript file (this reduces HTTP requests) and Minimize HTML, CSS, JavaScript (compression to accelerate load time).  6. Compatible with today's popular browsers:  
Compatible according to user preferences and designed so that it is compatible with all popular browsers today such as:  
Chrome, Mug, Fire Fox, Safira, IE, Mobile Browser,â€¦.  
7. Good fonts, colors, images to increase the attractiveness and persuasiveness of a website for users.  
 II)  	User and System requirements:  
II.1) User: 
-	The client should be able to check the books, the cost, the writer and the class of the book.  
-	The user should be able to navigate through book categories with a class toolbar-the user should not be able to access, monitor, edit or uninstall books, classes or admin accounts.   
-	To monitor, scan, review, uninstall books, classes, user profiles, the admin should be able to access the server.  
-	The admin should be able to create a class and show it to the client in the category side bar.  
II.2) System:  
 - A site server that can accommodate enough at the same time for 200 visits simultaneously. III) Design document of the website:  
III.1) Use case diagram:  
The image below is the use-case diagram for the website, with customer and admin as actors

III.2) Sitemap:

III.3) Design:  
Here are some of the designs that were used while the website was being developed, although only the important pages have been drawn out, not every single page, as there are pages that are easy to design and do not necessarily need to take much time to design.

V.I) Evaluation:  
The website was created and operates as planned for this project, although some changes have been made after the website was produced relative to the versions that were made, for instance, some of the pieces in the website design are changed from the final version. Although the benefit is that the website is running well, it has certain changes over the disadvantages: such as a book search engine and user interface class not only within the admin zone. The interface when zooming above 100% (less than 100% is fine), the contents and Several items should switch to one side. The upgrade client zone should have another input box to check the new password before adding it to the server, as it will be a nightmare if the new password is generated by destroying the keys and the current user is unable to sign in as the password is uncertain. The update book page does not have the price and author input boxes in which the adding of the book is not currently working. The account field of the admin should have a forget key or username click, or shopping cart installation, wish list,... etc... 
The list can go on and on, but given the drawbacks, the page, where the client can see the toolbar with categories on it and can be sorted, the key material just includes books, and when clicking on a novel, the detailed information of that particular book will be shown. The tasks work perfectly together on the admin side to create a system that handles books, classes and clients with functions upgrading and removing.
